# ionomicshub-app
iHUB Collaborative International Network for Ionomics. This application helps us in improving our understanding of how plants take up, transport and store their nutrient and toxic elements, collectively known as the ionome, which will benefit human health and the natural environment. Here you will find curated ionomic data on many thousands of plant samples freely available to the public.
